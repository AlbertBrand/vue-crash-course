    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the online crash course for <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>,
      crafted by <a href="https://twitter.com/al_bert_brand">Albert Brand</a>.
      This course is loosely based on the great documentation that comes with Vue.
      All examples and exercises are written in the
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">single file
        component</a> format.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and change the code on the left! Changes will be immediately
      reflected in the preview on the right, and console logs and errors are shown
      in the log below. The editor supports ES2017 syntax including
      <code>async/await</code>. However, expect <code>import</code> statements not
      to work: this is a crash course, not an IDE ☺.</p>
    <p>Changes are stored in local storage. If you want to revert the editor to
      its original content, you can press "<strong>⎌</strong>" on top of the
      screen.</p>
    <p>Use "<strong>⇦</strong>" and "<strong>⇨</strong>" to navigate quickly
      between pages, or use the menu on the left to jump to any subject.</p>
